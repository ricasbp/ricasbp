## Hi! Welcome to my GitHub page!

# I'm a graphics programmer, and find game development and graphics programming to be really interesting. 

Here are some of my github projects:

    Hekky Shaders, a collection of shaders which compliment Hekky PBR, aiming to allow for higher fidelity visuals in Unity with relative ease, all while aiming for high performance in VR.
    Augmented Hip, a custom, purely software based, virtual hip tracker, for SteamVR, which uses inverse kinematics for hip estimation, provided you have leg tracking.
    Hekky Shader Documentation, using Astro and custom controls, to generate a static documentation website from markdown.
    Amethyst Installer, the GUI installer for Amethyst.
    Pixelcord, a theme for popular social platform Discord.
