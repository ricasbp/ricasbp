# Hi! Welcome to my GitHub page! ðŸ¥½ðŸ’»
 
### I program everything related to VR/XR/AR, GPU's and Full-Stack Development.

Here are some of my github projects:


[BeMyHelper](https://github.com/ricasbp/BeMyHelper)
  - Android application to help people with mobility difficulties in Lisbon. 

Hekky Shaders, a collection of shaders which compliment Hekky PBR, aiming to allow for higher fidelity visuals in Unity with relative ease, all while aiming for high performance in VR.
Augmented Hip, a custom, purely software based, virtual hip tracker, for SteamVR, which uses inverse kinematics for hip estimation, provided you have leg tracking.
Hekky Shader Documentation, using Astro and custom controls, to generate a static documentation website from markdown.
Amethyst Installer, the GUI installer for Amethyst.
Pixelcord, a theme for popular social platform Discord.
